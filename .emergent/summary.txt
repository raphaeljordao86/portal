The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive fuel station client portal iteratively, addressing user requirements and fixing bugs. The development started from core features like authentication and vehicle management, then expanded to include limits, invoices, a dashboard, and advanced security features like 2FA. The AI demonstrated a strong ability to interpret complex requests, integrate third-party services (Z-API for WhatsApp, SMTP for email), and apply UI/UX best practices using Shadcn components and Tailwind CSS. A robust testing methodology, including calls to a  and self-verification via  and , was employed after each major implementation phase. Key challenges included debugging modal interactions and correctly configuring external APIs. The current state involves addressing backend errors and refining UI elements based on the latest user feedback, demonstrating a continuous improvement cycle.

<product_requirements>
The user required a client portal for a fuel station network to manage vehicle fleets.
**Initial Requirements:**
1.  **Vehicle Fleet Control:** Manage vehicle data (license plates, fuel types, etc.). No photos needed.
2.  **Invoice Viewing:** Display open invoices.
3.  **Fuel Limit Control:** Set daily, weekly, or monthly fuel limits by license plate. Limits can be by specific fuel type or value.
4.  **Fuel Release:** Mechanism to authorize fueling by license plate.
5.  **Fueling History:** View a complete history of all fuel transactions.
6.  **Authentication:** User/password login (CNPJ as username, auto-generated password with user-changeable option).
7.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Optional 2FA via WhatsApp or email for login.
8.  **Notifications:** WhatsApp notification when fuel limit reaches 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%. All fueling transactions must be sent to the client's email.
9.  **Dashboard:** Display information and charts (a plus feature).

**Subsequent Enhancements & Bug Fixes:**
1.  **Bug Fix - Novo Limite (New Limit):** Correct an issue where clicking new limit resulted in an empty string.
2.  **Z-API Configuration:** Provide specific Z-API credentials for WhatsApp integration.
3.  **Bug Fix - Login:** Correct an authentication issue where login was broken after 2FA implementation.
4.  **Specific 2FA Number:** Temporarily configure 2FA code sending to a specific WhatsApp number (+5534999402367).
5.  **Settings Page Refinement:** Remove credit information from the Configurações (Settings) tab.
6.  **Multiple Contacts:** Allow inclusion of multiple email addresses and WhatsApp numbers in user settings, with one designated as primary for 2FA.
7.  **Dashboard Filters:** Add monthly (default), weekly, daily, and custom date range filters to the dashboard.
8.  **Fuel Colors:** Use ANP (National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels) specific colors for fuel types in the UI.
9.  **UI Adjustments:** Enlarge the 3-line sidebar icon and position it further to the left. Move the dashboard filter out of its current card.
10. **Invoice Details:** Add a Detalhar (detail) option on invoice cards to show all associated fuel coupons.
11. **Quick Action Buttons:** Make quick action buttons on the dashboard functional.
12. **Credit Limit Display:** Display client credit limit and available balance on the Faturas (Invoices) tab.
13. **On-Screen Alerts:** Show an alert banner at the top of the screen when credit limit thresholds (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%) are reached.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with conducting a thorough test of all backend endpoints and correcting any identified errors. The user explicitly requested this (). The AI's last action was to acknowledge this and begin investigating by checking error logs to diagnose backend issues. This follows a previous test run (Chat Message 241) where a TESTING COMPLETE message was returned without explicit error details in the trajectory excerpt, leading the user to request a re-evaluation and correction of *all* backend errors.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Investigate the backend error logs to identify and fix any issues preventing full functionality.
